# Attestation Verifier - RiscZero

This repository implements a RiscZero based AWS Nitro Enclave attestation verifier.

While it produces zero false positives, it does not aim to produce zero false negatives, i.e. it could reject _theoretically_ valid attestations. Instead, it asserts specific attestation formats that are _actually_ used in order to optimize proving time. It also does not verify any extensions in the certificates as it was deemed unnecessary.

## Build

Install the RiscZero tooling before proceeding further.

Note: Requires CUDA by default. It is possible to disable CUDA by disabling the relevant feature in `host/Cargo.toml`, but the proof generation process could take hours on a CPU. 

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Reproducible builds

Reproducible builds are enabled for the guest to produce a consistent GUEST_ID.

Expected GUEST_ID: 0xdce6b83ae4bdcf22edbd23b86762ce08e98b1767eab21cdd3bb9d4d1c4d3e2b8

## Usage

```bash
$ ./target/release/host --help
GUEST: 0xdce6b83ae4bdcf22edbd23b86762ce08e98b1767eab21cdd3bb9d4d1c4d3e2b8
Usage: host --url <URL>

Options:
  -u, --url <URL>  
  -h, --help       Print help
  -V, --version    Print version
```

It takes in a URL to an attestation server producing binary attestations. The attestation server should include a 64 byte public key in the attestation.

## Journal format

The journal contains bytes in the following order:
- 8 byte timestamp in milliseconds from the attestation
- 48 byte PCR0
- 48 byte PCR1
- 48 byte PCR2
- 96 byte public key from the root certificate
- 1 byte length of the public key from the attestation
- N byte public key from the attestation
- 2 byte length of the user data
- N byte user data

# Attestation Server - Custom (Mock)

The custom attestation server generates attestations using a hardcoded cerificate chain and makes them available using a HTTP server. It expects callers to provide one or more of a public key, user data and nonce which are included in the attestation.

IMPORTANT: The attestations generated by this server are NOT real and NOT really secure. They are meant to be used during local development or a testing environment.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Reproducible builds

Reproducible builds can be done using Nix. The monorepo provides a Nix flake which includes this project and can be used to trigger builds:

```bash
nix build -v .#<flavor>.attestation.server-custom-mock.<output>
```

Supported flavors:
- `gnu`
- `musl`

Supported outputs:
- `default`, same as `compressed`
- `uncompressed`
- `compressed`, using `upx`
- `docker`, `uncompressed` binary packaged into a docker tar

## Usage

```
$ ./target/release/oyster-attestation-server-custom --help
http server for handling attestation document requests

Usage: oyster-attestation-server-custom [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -i, --ip-addr <IP_ADDR>  ip address of the server [default: 127.0.0.1:1350]
  -h, --help               Print help
  -V, --version            Print version

```

## Endpoints

The attestation server exposes attestations through two endpoints which encode the attestation in one of two format - raw and hex. The raw format is a binary format with the raw bytes of the attestation. The hex format is the same attestation, simply hex encoded. Therefore, the raw format is about half the size of the other while the hex format is ASCII letters and numbers only.

Both endpoints accept query parameters which can be used to set the public key, user data and nonce in the attestation document.

### Raw

##### Endpoint

`/attestation/raw`

##### Query params

- `public_key`: Optional, hex encoded public key without the `0x` prefix that is included in the `public_key` field of the attestation after being decoded into raw bytes
- `user_data`: Optional, hex encoded user data without the `0x` prefix that is included in the `user_data` field of the attestation after being decoded into raw bytes
- `nonce`: Optional, hex encoded nonce without the `0x` prefix that is included in the `nonce` field of the attestation after being decoded into raw bytes

While all query parameters are optional, any useful attestation will likely include at least the public key to extend the chain of trust.

##### Example

```
$ curl '<ip:port>/attestation/raw?public_key=<public_key>&user_data=<user_data>&nonce=<nonce>' -vs | xxd

### Hex

##### Endpoint

`/attestation/hex`

##### Query params

- `public_key`: Optional, hex encoded public key without the `0x` prefix that is included in the `public_key` field of the attestation after being decoded into raw bytes
- `user_data`: Optional, hex encoded user data without the `0x` prefix that is included in the `user_data` field of the attestation after being decoded into raw bytes

While all query parameters are optional, any useful attestation will likely include at least the public key to extend the chain of trust.

# Root of trust

The attestations include one root certificate in the `cabundle` field that is self-signed and one leaf certificate in the `certificate` field that is signed by the root certificate.

While verifying, the expected root public key is `0x6c79411ebaae7489a4e8355545c0346784b31df5d08cb1f7c0097836a82f67240f2a7201862880a1d09a0bb326637188fbbafab47a10abe3630fcf8c18d35d96532184985e582c0dce3dace8441f37b9cc9211dff935baae69e4872cc3494410`. You can match it against the root certificate below.

The certificates were generated using [certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap).
